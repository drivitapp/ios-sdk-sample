# **Configurations**



Drivit requires certain configurations to properly record user trips.

It's up to your app to properly inform the user why each configuration is required. Nevertheless, we feel we still have a role to play in helping you define the strings that explain each and every one of them, particularly because many situations benefit from specific expressions that are closely aligned with what the iOS asks the user.

As such, the following table provides the titles, subtitles & action button Drivit uses in its demo apps for your reference. Other translations will be added in the future.



|  ID  |             Permission<br />(Required)              | Description                                                  | Cell title | Cell subtitle                                                | Button title |
| :--: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------: |
| 100  | Location<br />(Always)<br /><br />Precise<br />(On) | The system requires your app to get the user’s authorization. To enable location for trip recording, it is important to have in mind some differences between iOS versions:<br />If you are using **iOS 12 or below**, it is required that the user requests the **Always** permission otherwise the app won't receive location updates in the background.<br />In **iOS 13**, when requesting for the first time, the user receives a request prompt asking for permission so the user can choose between **Allow Once**, **Allow While Using App**, and **Don't Allow**.<br />If the user grants **Allow Once** or **Allow While Using App** access, the SDK triggers immediatly an upgrade prompt so the user can choose between **Keep Only While Using** and **Change to Always Allow**. It is important that the user choose **Always**. <br />In addition, in **iOS 14**, the user can now control the precision of location information in the request prompt. Users can now choose to toggle 'Precise: On' or 'Precise: Off'. The default value is '**Precise: On**'.<br /><br />It is important that the user set location descriptions in the plist wisely otherwise the users won't select the **Always** permission. <br /><br />*Have in mind that we are treating the lack of precise location the same as missing location permission. If the precise location access is missing, this permission will return an error.*<br />*If the user have explicitly denied authorization request for this application, we won't be able to record their trips.* |  Location  | Without location or precision, we won't be able to detect your trips |   Resolve    |
| 101  |                Motion<br />(Accept)                 | The system requires your app to get the user’s authorization. When requesting for the first time, the user receives a request prompt asking for permission so the user can choose between **Deny** and **Accept**. The user needs to **Accept** it so we can better understand the user condition.<br /><br />*If the user have explicitly denied authorization request for this application, it is important the user enables it in the settings in order to better track their trips.* |   Motion   | Motion capabilities allow us to better detect your trips     |   Resolve    |
| 102  |                Background<br />(On)                 | This setting is **On** by default.<br /><br />*If the user have explicitly denied authorization for this application, we won't be able to record their trips.* | Background | Enable Background App Refresh for both Drivit (tap this message) and the System (see General Settings) |   Resolve    |
| 103  |                Power Mode<br />(Off)                | This setting is **Off** by default.<br /><br />*If the user have explicitly denied authorization for this application, some tasks might not work until the user turn off Low Power Mode. It is a recommendation to better track their trips.* | Power Mode | While in low power mode, Drivit is restricted by the system  |   Resolve    |
| 105  |                 Internet<br />(On)                  | This setting is **On** by default.<br /><br />*Internet connection is required for a more accurate recording and we may not have the conditions to record their trips efficiently without it*. |  Internet  | Without internet, the accuracy of your location is weaker and we may have to use GPS more often |   Resolve    |
